Linear regression: testing relationships and predicting outcome

I used visualizations to understand the distribution of the data;
I discovered the difference between dependent and explanatory variables in a beer consumption and the price of housing in the USA database available on Kaggle.
I learned to separate training and testing data;
I modeled with linear regressions;
I understood the errors due to residuals and metrics and compared and saved the best models.
